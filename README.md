CrediAI – AI-Based Credit Risk & Trust Scoring Platform

Description
CrediAI is an AI-powered credit assessment platform designed to evaluate the creditworthiness of small vendors and merchants using real-time business behavior instead of traditional credit bureau scores.
Unlike conventional systems such as CIBIL or GPay credit scores, CrediAI uses transaction patterns, repayment behavior, business stability, and compliance signals to generate:
A Trust Score
A Risk Level
A Loan Decision Recommendation
This enables fair and inclusive lending, especially for new or underbanked merchants.
