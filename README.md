## CrediAI – AI-Based Credit Risk & Trust Scoring Platform

## Description
CrediAI is an AI-powered credit assessment platform designed to evaluate the creditworthiness of small vendors and merchants using real-time business behavior instead of traditional credit bureau scores.

Unlike conventional systems such as CIBIL or GPay credit scores, CrediAI uses transaction patterns, repayment behavior, business stability, and compliance signals to generate:
- A Trust Score
- A Risk Level
- A Loan Decision Recommendation

This enables fair and inclusive lending, especially for new or underbanked merchants.

## Problem Statement
Traditional credit scoring systems rely heavily on historical loan data and bureau records, making it difficult for small vendors and first-time borrowers to access credit.

CrediAI solves this problem by providing an alternative credit scoring mechanism based on business activity and behavior rather than past loans.
